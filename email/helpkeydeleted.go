Key: {{.Fingerprint}}

This includes your email address so you won't receive any more automated emails like this one.


## Receiving secrets will no longer work

When someone sends you a secret, the fk application uses our server to search for your key based on your email address. This will no longer work.


## Carry on using Fluidkeys: extend and upload your key

If you want to carry on using Fluidkeys, you can extend and upload your public key by running:

fk key maintain
fk key upload

Once you've verified your email again, everything will work as before.


## What happened?

We'd love to know why you stopped using Fluidkeys, and we're very happy to help! Hit reply and let us know your thoughts.

Thanks,

Paul & Ian`
